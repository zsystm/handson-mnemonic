    "# HD Wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet) Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to HD Wallet\n",
    "### What is an HD Wallet?\n",
    "An HD Wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet) is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that uses a single seed phrase (mnemonic) to generate an entire hierarchy of private and public keys. This structure allows:\n",
    "- Easy backup and recovery through a single mnemonic phrase.\n",
    "- Deterministic generation of keys, ensuring consistent results across different software.\n",
    "- Enhanced security and usability through hierarchical key derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Convert a mnemonic into a seed.\n",
    "2. Derive the master key and chain code.\n",
    "3. Use the master key to derive child keys.\n",
    "4. Understand and implement derivation paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of an HD Wallet\n",
    "- **Mnemonic**: A human-readable set of words that encodes the entropy.\n",
    "- **Seed**: A 512-bit value derived from the mnemonic and an optional passphrase.\n",
    "- **Master Key & Chain Code**: The starting point for generating child keys in the hierarchy.\n",
    "- **Derivation Path**: A structured path that determines how keys are derived at each level of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Convert Mnemonic to Seed\n",
    "The mnemonic phrase, along with an optional passphrase, is transformed into a 64-byte seed using the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 algorithm. This seed is used as the basis for generating cryptographic keys in hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process and rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input Components\n",
    "- **Mnemonic**: A sequence of 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words derived from BIP-39 word lists. This serves as the primary input.\n",
    "- **Passphrase** (Optional): A user-defined string that enhances security by introducing additional entropy. If not provided, an empty string is used.\n",
    "- **Salt**: The passphrase is combined with the fixed prefix string \"mnemonic\" to form the salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 Process\n",
    "\n",
    "PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a standard algorithm used to securely derive a cryptographic key from a password or mnemonic. It works as follows:\n",
    "1. The algorithm uses HMAC-SHA512 as its hash function.\n",
    "2. The mnemonic, encoded as UTF-8, is used as the primary input.\n",
    "3. The salt, which is \"mnemonic\" concatenated with the optional passphrase, is also encoded as UTF-8.\n",
    "4. The algorithm performs 2048 iterations of HMAC-SHA512, repeatedly hashing the input to strengthen the derived key.\n",
    "5. The output is a fixed 64-byte (512-bit) seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 is driven by its ability to meet the following security and compatibility requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Resistance to Brute-Force Attacks**\n",
    "- PBKDF2 employs a computational delay by performing thousands of iterations, making brute-force attacks computationally expensive.\n",
    "- In BIP-39, the number of iterations is fixed at 2048, balancing security and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) Key Stretching**\n",
    "- Even if the mnemonic or passphrase is weak, the algorithm “stretches” its entropy, producing a stronger output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c) Standardized and Reliable**\n",
    "- PBKDF2 is widely adopted in cryptographic systems and follows the RFC 2898 standard, ensuring interoperability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d) HMAC-SHA512 Features**\n",
    "- HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) provides additional security by preventing hash collisions.\n",
    "- SHA-512 offers high resistance against cryptographic attacks, such as collision or pre-image attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e) Deterministic Output**\n",
    "- For the same mnemonic and passphrase, the derived seed will always be identical, ensuring deterministic wallet recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Security Implications\n",
    "- The optional passphrase acts as a “second factor,” making it significantly harder for an attacker to derive the seed from the mnemonic alone.\n",
    "- The derived 64-byte seed is then used in hierarchical deterministic wallets to generate the master key and master chain code, from which all child keys are derived."

    "## Step 3: Derive Child Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hardened Index?\n",
    "When deriving child keys, there are two types of derivation:\n",
    "- **Normal Derivation**: Allows the derived public key to be used to generate further child keys without revealing the private key.\n",
    "- **Hardened Derivation**: Adds an additional layer of security by preventing the derived public key from being used to deduce the parent private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Normal Derivation Work?\n",
    "In Normal Derivation, the child key is derived using the parent public key and chain code, without requiring the parent private key. This means:\n",
    "- Anyone with access to the parent public key and chain code can generate child public keys.\n",
    "- If a child private key is leaked and the chain code is also compromised, the parent private key can be calculated, posing a significant security risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Normal Derivation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Child Private Key = Parent Private Key + Derived Value (mod n)\n",
    "Child Public Key  = Parent Public Key + Derived Value * G\n",
    "```\n",
    "where Derived Value is computed using the chain code and index:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Derived Value = HMAC-SHA512(Chain Code, Index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since Normal Derivation relies only on the parent public key and chain code, an exposed chain code can lead to security vulnerabilities if a child private key is leaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Hardened Derivation Work?\n",
    "To enhance security, Hardened Derivation modifies the derivation process by requiring the parent private key to generate child keys. This prevents the derivation of further child keys from just the public key and chain code. The key distinction is:\n",
    "- In Hardened Derivation, the parent private key is included in the HMAC-SHA512 function, making it impossible to deduce the parent private key from any derived public key.\n",
    "- Even if a child private key is leaked, it does not compromise the parent key, ensuring better security.\n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate hardened derivation, the index is \"hardened\" by setting the most significant bit (MSB) to `1`. This is achieved by applying a bitwise OR operation with `0x80000000`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hardened_index = 0x80000000 | index\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value `0x80000000` corresponds to the 31st bit in the index, effectively ensuring that the index is within the hardened key space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security comparison: Normal vs. Hardened Derivation\n",
    "| Feature | Normal Derivation | Hardened Derivation |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Requires Parent Private Key? | ❌ N | ✅ Y |\n",
    "| Can Derived Child Public Keys from Parent Public Key? | ✅ Y | ❌ N |\n",
    "| Can Parent Private Key be Inferred from a Leaked Child Private Key? | ✅ Possible (if chain code is known) | ❌ N |\n",
    "| Chain Code Exposure Risk | ⚠️ High | ✅ Safe |\n",
    "| Recommended For | Non-sensitive addresses | High-security account separation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Hardened Derivation?\n",
    "Hardened keys ensure:\n",
    "1. **No backward traceability**: A compromised child key does not expose the parent private key.\n",
    "2. **Secure account separation**: Each hardened path (e.g., `account'`) is securely isolated from others.\n",
    "3. **Protection against chain code exposure**: Since the parent private key is required for hardened derivation, an exposed chain code alone is not enough to compromise security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for HD Wallet Security\n",
    "- **Use Hardened Derivation for critical keys**, such as account-level keys (m/44'/60'/0' in BIP-44).\n",
    "- **Never expose xpub (Extended Public Key) with chain code** to third parties unless necessary.\n",
    "- **Always securely store the seed**, as it derives both private keys and chain codes.\n",
    "- **Use a hardware wallet** to keep private keys isolated from networked environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these principles, HD wallets can ensure maximum security while maintaining flexibility in key generation."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated the key steps to:\n",
    "1. Convert a mnemonic to a seed.\n",
    "2. Derive the master key and chain code from the seed.\n",
    "3. Generate child keys using hierarchical deterministic derivation.\n",
    "4. Understand and implement derivation paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- The chain code is critical for securely linking parent and child keys.\n",
    "- Hardened derivation enhances security by preventing the exposure of parent private keys.\n",
    "- Derivation paths provide a structured approach to navigate the hierarchy of HD Wallet keys.\n"
